What does this do?
==================

A small wordpress plugin that expands the TinyMCE kitchen sink to show the second toolbar, then modifies it to fit on one toolbar if the screen is wide enough, minimizing space.

Installing this Plugin
======================

Upload the php file to your wp-content/plugins/ directory, or package it in a zip file and upload via the admin interface
